# Projects
The definitive list of all current and past projects I'm working on.

### Current Projects:
* LSTMjazz - Generating jazz improv using LSTMs. Many hours of research and coding are still going strong...

### Completed Projects:
* MNIST Classifier using Keras - Also includes instructions for data preprocessing and Kaggle submission. I did studied to 
ensure that I understood all algorithms used, including CNNs, Dropout, and the Adam optimizer. (Python, Keras)
* Perceptron Demo - A simple perceptron I coded which can classify linear relationships. (Python, matplotlib, numpy)

## Projects on Ice:
* Decision Trees in Pandas - Learning about data manipulation, creating my own implementation of decision trees and eventually 
random forests using Kaggle's Titanic dataset.
* Gentrification Analysis using Data Science - Learning about APIs as well as some urban infrastructure insights.
* Blocktr[AI]n - A library for Keras models using some variations on the Blockchain model. Very much a proof-of-concept as 
opposed to a full working prototype.

### Future Ideas/Interests:
* Reinforcement learning agent in Unity.
* Sightreading application that allows the practice of transposing as well (A first stab at app dev)
* Composition app augmented by generative ML interaction (This one's a long way off)
* GAN optimization methods, CycleGAN, DiscoGAN, or BigGAN experiments?
* Linguistics semantic/syntactic rules as logic statements --> Binary trees?
