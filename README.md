# Projects
The definitive list of all current and past projects I'm working on.

### Current Projects:
* LSTMjazz - Generating jazz improv using LSTMs. Also creating a Raspberry Pi system to eventually input chords live.
* Gentrification Analysis using Neural Networks. Hope to learn some APIs as well as some urban infrastructure insights.
* Blocktr[AI]n - A library for Keras models using some variation on Blockchain.

### Completed Projects:
* MNIST Classifier using Keras - I coded this in a few days; it's nothing novel but I did study and work to understand all algorithms used, including CNNs, Dropout, and the Adam optimizer. (Python, Keras)
* Perceptron Demo - Just a simple perceptron I coded which can classify linear relationships. (Python, matplotlib, numpy)

### Future Ideas/Interests:
* Reinforcement learning agent in Unity.
* Composition app augmented by generative ML interaction (This one's a long way off)
* GAN optimization methods, CycleGAN or DiscoGAN
