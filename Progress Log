1. Gentrification Analysis using Neural Networks. Last worked on: 10/19/2018. Total time: 1 hour

10/19/2018 - I spent an hour setting up this document before beginning some background research into the causes and effects of gentrification. Also sent out messages to a few sources asking for any considerations I should make in order to remain socially conscious of any broad pictures I might otherwise fail to consider. Seems like an interesting topic with a ton of possible avenues for exploration.

2. Blocktr[AI]n - A library for Keras models using some variation on Blockchain. Total time: 0 hours
