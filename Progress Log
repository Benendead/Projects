1. Gentrification Analysis using Neural Networks/Data Science.
Last worked on: 10/22/2018. Total time: 2 hours

10/19/2018 - I spent an hour setting up this document before beginning some background research into the causes and effects of 
gentrification. Also sent out messages to a few sources asking for any considerations I should make in order to remain 
socially conscious of any broad pictures I might otherwise fail to consider. Seems like an interesting topic with a ton of 
possible avenues for exploration.

10/22/2018 - Another hour gentrification, this time finishing the first overview article and beginning another on one 
approach which used Yelp reviews to quantify gentrification. There's certainly research related to what I'd like to study 
here, which is simultaneously promising and daunting because I'll need to differentiate my methods explicitly.

2. Blocktr[AI]n - A library for Keras models using some variation on Blockchain. Total time: 0 hours
