1. Gentrification Analysis using Neural Networks/Data Science.
Last worked on: 10/24/2018. Total time: 4 hours

10/19/2018 - I spent an hour setting up this document before beginning some background research into the causes and effects of 
gentrification. Also sent out messages to a few sources asking for any considerations I should make in order to remain 
socially conscious of any broad pictures I might otherwise fail to consider. Seems like an interesting topic with a ton of 
possible avenues for exploration.

10/22/2018 - Another hour gentrification, this time finishing the first overview article and beginning another on one 
approach which used Yelp reviews to quantify gentrification. There's certainly research related to what I'd like to study 
here, which is simultaneously promising and daunting because I'll need to differentiate my methods explicitly.

10/23/2018 - Spent the hour today studying what APIs are by following through about half of an hour-long video on Web APIs. 
I've so far learned the basic processes for using and meaning of web APIs as well as a few examples of how they can be used.

10/24/2018 - In my hour today, I finished the API video and read multiple articles on uses of big data on analyzing city 
dynamics. I've compiled a number of sources on both big data uses relating to cities and some on useful APIs. These two 
avenues will round out my knowledge on what's been done in this area of study and similarly give me some ideas for the tools 
already out there regarding API access to datasets/insights. I plan to read through what I've gathered before cutting myself 
off, considering my options, and beginning to develop my own ideas for the project. That's the path forward.
